Create a posts directory at the root of your project with an MDX file. Inside the MDX file add Frontmatter and placeholder text.

With the gatsby-source-filesystem plugin, you can query the files in the posts directory. Finally, install gatsby-plugin-mdx, @mdx-js/mdx and @mdx-js/react to process the MDX files so they can be queried in the project.
